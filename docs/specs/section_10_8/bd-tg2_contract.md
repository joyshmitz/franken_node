# bd-tg2 Contract: Fleet Control API for Quarantine/Revocation Operations

**Bead:** bd-tg2
**Section:** 10.8 (Operational Readiness)
**Status:** In Progress
**Owner:** CrimsonCrane
**Priority:** P2

## Overview

The fleet control API is the programmatic interface that turns engine-level
quarantine and revocation primitives into operator-accessible operations. It is
the backbone of the fleet quarantine UX (10.0 Initiative #6) and supports all
operational incident response workflows. Without a well-defined fleet control
surface, operators have no structured way to quarantine compromised extensions,
revoke trust across zones, track convergence of fleet-wide actions, or roll back
quarantine state after investigation.

This bead implements the fleet control API that enables quarantine and revocation
operations with zone/tenant scoping, convergence tracking, and rollback
capabilities. All operations produce signed decision receipts (10.5), adopt the
canonical structured observability and stable error taxonomy contracts from
10.13, and start in deterministic safe-mode (read-only) until explicitly
activated.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path                                  | Description                                              | Auth              |
|--------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| POST   | `/v1/fleet/quarantine`                | Quarantine an extension within a scope                   | mTLS + fleet-admin|
| POST   | `/v1/fleet/revoke`                    | Revoke trust for an extension within a scope             | mTLS + fleet-admin|
| POST   | `/v1/fleet/release/{incident_id}`     | Release quarantine and roll back quarantine state         | mTLS + fleet-admin|
| GET    | `/v1/fleet/status/{zone}`             | Query fleet status for a zone                            | Bearer + operator |
| POST   | `/v1/fleet/reconcile`                 | Trigger fleet-wide reconciliation of quarantine state    | mTLS + fleet-admin|

All mutation endpoints (POST) require the `fleet-admin` role and mTLS client
certificate authentication. The read-only status endpoint allows the broader
`operator` role with bearer token authentication. All endpoints propagate
W3C trace context headers.

### POST /v1/fleet/quarantine

Request body:

```json
{
  "extension_id": "ext-abc123",
  "scope": {
    "scope_type": "zone",
    "zone_ids": ["zone-us-east-1", "zone-us-west-2"],
    "tenant_ids": null
  },
  "reason": "CVE-2026-1234 active exploitation",
  "trace_id": "trace-abc-001"
}
```

Response: `FleetActionResult` with `action_type: "quarantine"`, incident handle,
convergence state, and signed decision receipt.

### POST /v1/fleet/revoke

Request body:

```json
{
  "extension_id": "ext-abc123",
  "scope": {
    "scope_type": "tenant",
    "zone_ids": null,
    "tenant_ids": ["tenant-acme", "tenant-globex"]
  },
  "reason": "Trust revocation after forensic analysis",
  "trace_id": "trace-abc-002"
}
```

Response: `FleetActionResult` with `action_type: "revocation"`, signed decision
receipt, and convergence tracking handle.

### POST /v1/fleet/release/{incident_id}

Deterministically rolls back the quarantine state associated with the given
incident. The rollback is verified -- the API confirms that all nodes in the
original scope have returned to pre-quarantine state before reporting success.

Response: `FleetActionResult` with `action_type: "release"`, rollback
verification report, and signed decision receipt.

### GET /v1/fleet/status/{zone}

Returns the current fleet status for the specified zone, including active
quarantines, pending revocations, convergence progress, and node health summary.

Response: `FleetStatus` with zone summary, active actions, and convergence
states.

### POST /v1/fleet/reconcile

Triggers a full fleet-wide reconciliation pass. Compares desired quarantine
and revocation state against actual node state across all zones. Reports
divergences and initiates corrective actions for any drift detected.

Response: `FleetActionResult` with `action_type: "reconcile"`, divergence
report, and corrective action summary.

Each variant exposes a `code() -> &'static str` method returning the
machine-readable error code, and implements `Display` with a human-readable
message including relevant context (scope details, zone IDs, timeout duration,
rollback failure reason, etc.).

### FleetControlEvent (struct)

Structured audit event emitted by fleet control operations:

| Field        | Type        | Description                                          |

| Released   | Quarantine released, post-incident review complete       |

### FleetControlManager (struct)

Central manager for fleet quarantine/revocation operations.  Starts in
read-only mode (INV-FLEET-SAFE-START) and must be explicitly activated
before mutation operations are allowed.

| Field            | Type                              | Description                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| activated        | bool                              | Whether API is activated              |
| incidents        | HashMap\<String, IncidentHandle\> | Active incidents by ID                |
| zone\_status     | HashMap\<String, FleetStatus\>    | Per-zone status                       |
| events           | Vec\<FleetControlEvent\>          | Audit trail events                    |

## Invariants

| Invariant ID            | Statement                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INV-FLEET-ZONE-SCOPE    | Every quarantine and revocation operation must specify a valid scope. The scope must reference at least one existing zone or tenant. Global scope requires explicit confirmation. `ScopeInvalid` is returned for empty or malformed scopes. Scope validation occurs before any state mutation. |
| INV-FLEET-RECEIPT        | Every mutation (quarantine, revoke, release, reconcile) produces a signed decision receipt before returning to the caller. The receipt includes the action ID, scope, timestamp, operator identity, and a cryptographic signature. Receipts are persisted in the incident bundle system (10.5). No mutation completes without a receipt. |
| INV-FLEET-CONVERGENCE    | Every fleet action tracks propagation progress via `ConvergenceState`. The API reports the number of converged, failed, and pending nodes along with an estimated completion time. A `ConvergenceTimeout` error is raised if convergence does not complete within the configured timeout (default: 300 seconds). |
| INV-FLEET-SAFE-START     | The fleet control API starts in read-only safe mode. All mutation endpoints return `FleetNotActivated` until explicit activation. The status endpoint is always available regardless of activation state. Activation requires the `fleet-admin` role and produces a signed activation receipt. |
| INV-FLEET-ROLLBACK       | The release command deterministically rolls back quarantine state. Rollback is verified -- the API confirms that all nodes in the original scope have returned to pre-quarantine state. If rollback fails on any node, the operation returns `RollbackFailed` with details of which nodes could not be restored. Partial rollback state is explicitly reported, never silently swallowed. |

## Event Codes

| Code     | Event Name              | Severity | Description                                                                    |
|----------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FLEET-001| QUARANTINE_INITIATED    | WARN     | Quarantine action initiated (extension_id, scope, zone_ids, trace_id)          |
| FLEET-002| REVOCATION_ISSUED       | WARN     | Revocation issued (extension_id, scope, revocation_depth, cascade_policy)      |
| FLEET-003| CONVERGENCE_PROGRESS    | INFO     | Convergence progress update (action_id, converged/total, progress_pct, ETA)    |
| FLEET-004| FLEET_RELEASED          | INFO     | Quarantine released and rollback verified (incident_id, scope, nodes_restored) |
| FLEET-005| RECONCILE_COMPLETED     | INFO     | Fleet-wide reconciliation completed (divergences_found, corrective_actions)    |

All events carry a non-empty `trace_id` for distributed tracing correlation.
Events are emitted on both success and failure paths. The event structure
follows the canonical structured observability contracts from 10.13 (bd-1ta).

## Error Codes

| Code                         | Description                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FLEET_SCOPE_INVALID          | Scope references unknown zone/tenant IDs, is empty, or is malformed     |
| FLEET_ZONE_UNREACHABLE       | One or more zones in the scope cannot be contacted                       |
| FLEET_CONVERGENCE_TIMEOUT    | Fleet action did not converge within the configured timeout              |
| FLEET_ROLLBACK_FAILED        | Release/rollback could not restore pre-quarantine state on all nodes     |
| FLEET_NOT_ACTIVATED          | Fleet control API is in safe-mode and requires explicit activation       |

Error codes follow the stable error taxonomy contracts from 10.13. Each error
code is a `&'static str` constant and is included in both the API response body
and the structured log event. Error responses include the error code, a
human-readable message, and contextual fields (scope, zone IDs, timeout
duration, failed node list, etc.).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **API endpoints implemented:** All five fleet control endpoints are
   implemented: `quarantine(extension_id, scope)`, `revoke(extension_id, scope)`,
   `release(incident_id)`, `status(zone)`, `reconcile()`. Each endpoint accepts
   the documented request schema and returns the documented response type.
   Route metadata is registered with correct HTTP methods, paths, auth methods,
   and policy hooks.

2. **Scope control with blast-radius metadata:** Quarantine and revocation
   operations accept a `QuarantineScope` that scopes to zones and/or tenants.
   Invalid scopes (empty zone list, unknown zone IDs) are rejected with
   `FLEET_SCOPE_INVALID`. Blast-radius metadata (affected node count, zone
   count) is included in the `FleetActionResult`.

3. **Convergence tracking with estimated completion:** The API reports
   propagation progress via `ConvergenceState` in every `FleetActionResult`.
   Progress includes converged/total node counts, a percentage, and an estimated
   completion time. `CONVERGENCE_PROGRESS` events (FLEET-003) are emitted as
   nodes acknowledge the action. `FLEET_CONVERGENCE_TIMEOUT` is raised if the
   configured timeout (default 300s) is exceeded.

4. **Deterministic rollback with verification:** The `release` command rolls
   back quarantine state for all nodes in the original scope. Rollback is
   verified -- the API confirms pre-quarantine state restoration on every node
   before returning success. `FLEET_ROLLBACK_FAILED` is returned if any node
   cannot be restored, with a list of failed nodes. The `FLEET_RELEASED` event
   (FLEET-004) includes the count of nodes restored.

5. **Signed decision receipts:** Every mutation (quarantine, revoke, release,
   reconcile) produces a signed decision receipt conforming to the 10.5 receipt
   format. The receipt is included in the `FleetActionResult` response and
   persisted in the incident bundle system. Receipts include action ID, scope,
   operator identity, timestamp, and cryptographic signature.

6. **Canonical structured observability:** All five event codes (FLEET-001
   through FLEET-005) are emitted with the 10.13 canonical event structure
   including non-empty `trace_id`, `action_id`, zone metadata, and ISO 8601
   timestamps. All five error codes follow the stable error taxonomy with
   machine-readable codes and structured context fields.

7. **Deterministic safe-mode startup:** The fleet control API starts in
   read-only mode. All mutation endpoints return `FLEET_NOT_ACTIVATED`
   (FleetControlError::NotActivated) until explicit activation. The `status`
   endpoint is always available. Activation requires `fleet-admin` role and
   produces a signed activation receipt. Unit tests verify that mutations are
   rejected before activation and succeed after activation.

8. **Integration with incident bundle system:** Quarantine and revocation
   actions create an `IncidentHandle` that references the incident bundle
   retention system (10.5, bd-20a). The `release` endpoint accepts an
   `incident_id` from the handle. Post-incident evidence (action log,
   convergence timeline, decision receipts) is collected in the incident bundle
   for retention.
