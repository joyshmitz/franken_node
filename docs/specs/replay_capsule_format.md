# Replay Capsule Format Specification (bd-nbwo)

## Section

10.17 -- Radical Expansion Execution Track

## Overview

This specification defines the universal verifier SDK replay capsule format.
External verifiers replay detached-signature-bound capsules to reproduce claim
verdicts without requiring privileged internal access. The capsule schema and
verification APIs are stable and versioned.

The capsule format builds on the verifier-economy SDK (Section 10.12) and the
universal verifier SDK module (`connector::universal_verifier_sdk`), which is
the replacement-critical implementation surface. That connector module signs
and verifies capsules with detached Ed25519 signatures over a canonical signing
payload that binds manifest fields, metadata, payload bytes, and ordered
inputs.

The standalone workspace crate `sdk/verifier` is structural-only. It exposes
deterministic schema, replay, and structural signature digest helpers for
external tooling, but it is not the replacement-critical canonical verifier and
does not claim detached cryptographic verification authority.

## Capsule Format

A replay capsule is a self-contained, structurally bound unit consisting of:

1. **CapsuleManifest** -- metadata describing the capsule's contents, schema
   version, claim type, expected output hash, and creator identity.
2. **Payload** -- serialized data to replay.
3. **Inputs** -- deterministic-ordered (BTreeMap) input artifacts keyed by
   reference identifier.
4. **Signature** -- detached Ed25519 signature covering the manifest, payload,
   metadata, input refs, and inputs via the canonical signing payload.

External replay callers identify themselves with a non-empty
`verifier://...` `verifier_identity`. Other schemes are treated as
privileged/internal identities and are rejected by the workspace replay
capsule companion surface.

### Schema Version

All capsules carry `schema_version = "vsdk-v1.0"`. The version is checked
during manifest validation; unsupported versions are rejected.

### Manifest Binding Requirements

`expected_output_hash` must be a 64-character hex sha256 digest.

Declared `input_refs` must be unique and exactly match the replayed `inputs`
keys.

### Detached Signature Coverage

The detached Ed25519 signature is computed over a canonical signing payload
that binds the following material:

- `capsule_id`
- `schema_version`
- `description`
- `claim_type`
- `expected_output_hash`
- `created_at`
- `creator_identity`
- `payload`
- ordered `input_refs`
- manifest metadata entries (including signer metadata)
- each input as `key=value` in `BTreeMap` order with length-prefixed encoding

## Replay Protocol

1. Validate the capsule manifest (schema version, required fields, and
   `expected_output_hash` shape).
2. Validate `verifier_identity` as a non-empty external `verifier://...`
   identity and reject privileged/internal schemes.
3. Verify the capsule detached Ed25519 signature against the canonical signing
   payload using the signer public key embedded in manifest metadata.
4. Verify the declared `input_refs` are unique and exactly match the replayed
   `inputs` set.
5. Verify the payload is non-empty.
6. Compute the deterministic output hash from payload and inputs.
7. Compare the actual output hash against `expected_output_hash`.
8. Emit verdict: PASS if hashes match, FAIL otherwise.

## Verification Sessions

Multi-step verification workflows are modeled as `VerificationSession`:

- Sessions start empty and unsealed.
- Replay results are appended as `SessionStep` entries (append-only).
- Sessions can be sealed, computing a final verdict (PASS only if all steps
  passed, INCONCLUSIVE if no steps).
- Sealed sessions reject further step additions.
