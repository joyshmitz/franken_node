# bd-390 Contract: Anti-Entropy Reconciliation

**Bead:** bd-390
**Section:** 10.11 (FrankenSQLite-Inspired Runtime Systems)
**Status:** Active

## Purpose

Implement O(delta) anti-entropy reconciliation for distributed product trust
state.  Two nodes exchange Merkle-Mountain-Range digests and reconcile only
the differing records, producing proof-carrying recovery artifacts for each
reconciled entry.  Epoch boundaries are enforced fail-closed.

## Algorithm

1. Each node computes an MMR digest over its trust-state records.
2. Nodes exchange digests and diff via MMR prefix comparison → O(delta).
3. Missing/divergent records are bundled with MMR inclusion proofs.
4. Records are applied through a two-phase obligation channel (atomic).
5. Epoch-scoped validity: reject records from future epochs.
6. Fork detection: divergent histories trigger halt-and-alert.

## Data Structures

| mmr_pos     | u64      | MMR leaf position                   |
| mmr_proof   | Vec<[u8;32]> | MMR inclusion proof hashes    |

### `ReconciliationResult`

| Field             | Type   | Description                         |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| delta_size        | usize  | Number of differing records         |

| records_rejected  | usize  | Rejected (epoch/proof/fork)         |
| elapsed_ms        | u64    | Wall-clock time in milliseconds     |
| fork_detected     | bool   | Whether fork was detected           |
| cancelled         | bool   | Whether reconciliation was cancelled|

## Event Codes

| Code      | Severity | Description                                    |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| FN-AE-001 | INFO    | Reconciliation cycle started                   |
| FN-AE-002 | INFO    | Delta computed between local and remote state  |
| FN-AE-003 | INFO    | Record accepted and applied                    |
| FN-AE-004 | WARN    | Record rejected (epoch/proof violation)         |
| FN-AE-005 | INFO    | Reconciliation cycle completed                 |
| FN-AE-006 | ERROR   | Fork detected, reconciliation halted           |
| FN-AE-007 | WARN    | Reconciliation cancelled mid-cycle             |
| FN-AE-008 | INFO    | Replay of already-reconciled record (idempotent)|

## Invariants

- **INV-AE-DELTA** — Reconciliation processes only O(delta) records, not
  full state.
- **INV-AE-ATOMIC** — Partial reconciliation failures leave local state
  unchanged (two-phase rollback).
- **INV-AE-EPOCH** — Records from future epochs (epoch > local_current)
  are rejected fail-closed.
- **INV-AE-PROOF** — Every reconciled record includes a verifiable MMR
  inclusion proof.

## Error Codes

| Code                     | Description                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ERR_AE_INVALID_CONFIG    | Configuration parameter out of range     |
| ERR_AE_EPOCH_VIOLATION   | Record epoch exceeds local current epoch |
| ERR_AE_PROOF_INVALID     | MMR inclusion proof verification failed  |
| ERR_AE_FORK_DETECTED     | Divergent histories detected             |
| ERR_AE_CANCELLED         | Reconciliation cancelled mid-cycle       |
| ERR_AE_BATCH_EXCEEDED    | Delta exceeds max_delta_batch            |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. O(delta) reconciliation: two states with N records, K differing → O(K) work.
2. Every reconciled record includes verifiable MMR inclusion proof.
3. Future-epoch records rejected with structured error event.
4. Crash/cancellation mid-reconciliation leaves state unchanged.
5. Structured log events FN-AE-001 through FN-AE-008.
6. Fork detection triggers halt-and-alert.
7. Replay of already-reconciled records is idempotent.
8. >= 30 unit tests.
9. Verification script passes all checks.
