# ZK Attestation Contract -- bd-kcg9

## Section

10.17 -- Radical Expansion Execution Track

## Overview

Zero-knowledge attestation support for selective compliance verification.
Verifiers can validate compliance predicates without privileged disclosure of
full private metadata.  Invalid or forged proofs fail admission deterministically.

## Invariants

| ID                        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INV-ZK-NO-DISCLOSURE      | Proofs reveal only the compliance predicate result, never full metadata.    |
| INV-ZK-PROOF-SOUNDNESS    | Forged or corrupted proofs are rejected deterministically.                  |
| INV-ZK-FAIL-CLOSED        | On any verification error the system denies admission.                     |
| INV-ZK-PREDICATE-COMPLETENESS | Valid proofs for satisfied predicates always pass verification.         |
| INV-ZKA-SELECTIVE          | Alias: proofs reveal only predicate results, not private metadata.         |
| INV-ZKA-SOUNDNESS          | Alias: forged proofs rejected with deterministic error.                    |
| INV-ZKA-COMPLETENESS       | Alias: valid proof for satisfied predicate passes within timeout.          |
| INV-ZKA-POLICY-BOUND       | Attestation bound to a specific ZkPolicy; cross-policy proofs rejected.    |
| INV-ZKA-AUDIT-TRAIL        | Every verification attempt logged with trace ID, timestamp, policy ref.    |
| INV-ZKA-SCHEMA-VERSIONED   | All serialised payloads carry a schema version tag.                        |

## Types

- `ZkAttestation` -- generated proof attesting to a compliance predicate.
- `ZkPolicy` -- defines predicate, issuer, and validity constraints.
- `ZkVerificationResult` -- outcome of verifying a single attestation.
- `ZkBatchResult` -- outcome of verifying a batch of attestations.
- `ZkAuditRecord` -- log entry for an attestation event.
- `PredicateOutcome` -- enum: Pass / Fail / Error.
- `AttestationStatus` -- lifecycle enum: Active / Expired / Revoked.
- `PolicyRegistry` -- BTreeMap-backed registry of active policies.
- `AttestationLedger` -- BTreeMap-backed ledger of all attestations.
- `ZkProofPayload` -- raw proof bytes with schema version tag.

## Methods

- `generate_proof` -- produce a ZkAttestation from private data and a ZkPolicy.
- `verify_proof` -- verify a ZkAttestation against a ZkPolicy.
- `verify_batch` -- verify multiple attestations, returning a ZkBatchResult.
- `register_policy` -- add a ZkPolicy to the PolicyRegistry.
- `deregister_policy` -- remove a ZkPolicy from the PolicyRegistry.
- `revoke_attestation` -- mark a previously issued attestation as revoked.
- `query_audit` -- return audit records matching a filter.
- `is_valid` -- check if an attestation is still active and within its validity window.
- `sweep_expired` -- mark all expired attestations and return them.
- `generate_compliance_report` -- summary of attestation outcomes for a policy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Verifiers can validate compliance predicates without privileged disclosure
   of full private metadata.
2. Invalid or forged proofs fail admission deterministically.
3. Every verification is bound to a specific ZkPolicy; cross-policy proofs are
   rejected.
4. All events produce structured log entries with stable event codes.
5. All serialised types carry a schema version for forward compatibility.
6. BTreeMap is used for all ordered collections.
7. At least 20 inline unit tests under `#[cfg(test)]`.
