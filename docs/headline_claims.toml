# franken_node Headline Claims Registry
#
# Each claim entry defines a verifiable headline claim made by the project.
# The reproduction system uses this registry to determine what to verify
# and how to evaluate results.
#
# Required fields per claim:
#   claim_id             - Unique identifier (HC-NNN)
#   claim_text           - Human-readable claim statement
#   verification_method  - How the claim is verified (test_suite, benchmark, audit)
#   acceptance_threshold - Quantitative pass/fail boundary
#   test_reference       - Path to the specific test or benchmark
#   category             - One of: compatibility, security, performance, migration, trust
