# Safe-Mode Operations Governance Policy

## Purpose

This policy governs the lifecycle of safe-mode operation in franken_node:
when to enter safe mode, what capability restrictions apply, how flag
precedence is resolved, and the required recovery procedures to exit.

## Scope

Applies to all franken_node deployments -- standalone, fleet-managed, and
development instances.  No deployment may override the core invariants
(INV-SMO-DETERMINISTIC, INV-SMO-RESTRICTED, INV-SMO-FLAGPARSE,
INV-SMO-RECOVERY) defined in the bd-k6o contract.

## When to Enter Safe Mode

### Mandatory Entry

Safe mode MUST be entered under any of these conditions:

1. **Explicit operator request**: The `--safe-mode` CLI flag, the
   `FRANKEN_SAFE_MODE=1` environment variable, or the `safe_mode: true`
   configuration field activates safe mode unconditionally.

2. **Trust state corruption**: When the trust re-verification detects
   inconsistencies between the trust state and the evidence ledger, safe
   mode activates automatically.  This is a non-negotiable safety
   mechanism.

3. **Crash loop detection**: When the crash loop detector records 3 or more
   crashes within a 60-second window (configurable), safe mode activates
   to prevent cascading failures.

4. **Epoch mismatch**: When the local control epoch does not match the
   federation epoch, safe mode activates to prevent stale-state operations.

### Advisory Entry

Operators SHOULD consider entering safe mode during:

- Planned maintenance windows affecting trust infrastructure.
- Investigation of anomalous extension behavior.
- Post-incident recovery before full operational restoration.

## Capability Restrictions

### Restricted Capabilities (Safe Mode Active)

| Capability | Restriction | Recovery Hint |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Extension loading (non-essential) | Blocked | Exit safe mode and restart with extensions enabled |
| Trust delegation issuance | Blocked | Resolve trust state inconsistencies first |
| Trust ledger writes | Requires explicit operator confirmation | Confirm write via `--force-write` flag |
| Outbound network (non-health) | Blocked | Use `--no-network` to explicitly control |
| Scheduled tasks | Suspended | Tasks resume after safe-mode exit |
| Network listeners (non-essential) | Suspended | Only health and admin endpoints active |

### Unrestricted Capabilities (Always Available)

- Health check endpoints.
- Admin/diagnostic endpoints.
- Read access to trust state and evidence ledger.
- CLI status and diagnostic commands.
- Structured logging and telemetry emission.

## Flag Precedence

When multiple operation flags are specified, precedence is resolved as:

1. `--safe-mode` (highest) -- activates all safe-mode restrictions.
2. `--read-only` -- prohibits all write operations.
3. `--no-network` -- disables outbound network access.
4. `--degraded` (lowest) -- enters degraded-capability mode.

A higher-precedence flag subsumes the restrictions of lower-precedence flags
where they overlap.  For example, `--safe-mode` already implies read-only
behavior for trust ledger writes, so `--read-only` is redundant for that
specific capability but still applies to other write operations.

### Conflict Resolution

- `--safe-mode` combined with `--degraded` emits SMO-003 (advisory: safe mode
  already restricts more than degraded mode).
- No flag combination is treated as an error.  All flags are applied
  additively.

## Recovery Procedures

### Pre-Exit Checklist

Before exiting safe mode, the following conditions MUST be verified:

1. **Trust state consistency**: Trust re-verification passes with zero
   inconsistencies.
2. **No unresolved incidents**: All incidents flagged during safe-mode
   operation are resolved or explicitly acknowledged.
3. **Evidence ledger intact**: The evidence ledger is complete and hash
   chain is valid.
4. **Operator confirmation**: The operator explicitly confirms the
   transition via `franken-node safe-mode exit --confirm`.

### Exit Procedure

1. Operator issues exit command.
2. System runs pre-exit verification checklist.
3. If all checks pass, system prompts for confirmation.
4. Operator confirms.
5. System restores suspended capabilities in deterministic order.
6. System logs exit event with operator identity and timestamp.
7. System emits SMO-001 event for the transition.

### Failed Exit

If the pre-exit checklist fails:

- The system remains in safe mode.
- A detailed report of failing checks is emitted.
- The operator may choose to resolve the issues and retry, or to
  force-exit (which is logged as a policy override and triggers an
  escalation alert).

## Audit and Evidence

- Every safe-mode entry and exit is logged as an auditable event.
- Safe-mode entry receipts are persisted with: timestamp, entry reason,
  trust state hash, and inconsistency list.
- All operations performed during safe mode are logged at TRACE level.
- Evidence artifacts are retained for the configured retention period
  (minimum 90 days).

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Dashboard integration: safe-mode state is surfaced on the operator
  dashboard with entry reason and duration.
- Alert pipeline: safe-mode entry from automatic triggers (trust
  corruption, crash loop, epoch mismatch) generates an immediate alert
  to the on-call operator.
- Velocity metric: safe-mode entry frequency is tracked as a health
  indicator.  More than 2 entries per 24-hour period triggers an
  escalation review.

## Review Cadence

This policy is reviewed quarterly or after any incident that reveals
gaps in safe-mode coverage.  Changes require approval from the platform
security team and the operations team lead.
