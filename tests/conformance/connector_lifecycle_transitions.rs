//! Conformance tests: Connector lifecycle transition matrix.
//!
//! Exhaustively tests every (source, target) pair in the lifecycle FSM
//! to verify that legal transitions succeed and illegal transitions are
//! rejected with stable error codes.
//!
//! Corresponds to bd-2gh acceptance criteria:
//! - FSM is complete and deterministic for all states
//! - Illegal transitions return stable codes
//! - Full transition matrix tests pass

// NOTE: These tests reference the connector lifecycle module.
// Since the binary crate uses `pub mod connector`, we import via the
// module path. For integration testing in a binary crate, we define
// the tests as unit tests within the crate (see lifecycle.rs #[cfg(test)]).
//
// This file serves as the conformance specification document and can be
// compiled as a standalone test when the crate is restructured as a library.
