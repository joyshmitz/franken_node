# bd-80g: Reference Capture Programs & Fixture Corpora — Verification Summary

## Bead
- **ID**: bd-80g
- **Section**: 10.2
- **Title**: Build prioritized Node/Bun reference capture programs and fixture corpora per API band

## Artifacts Created

### Reference Capture Programs
- `scripts/captures/capture_fs.js` — fs API family capture (readFile, writeFile)
- `scripts/captures/capture_path.js` — path API family capture (join, resolve, parse, dirname, basename, extname)
- `scripts/captures/capture_process.js` — process API family capture (env, argv, cwd, pid, version)

### Fixture Corpus (27 total fixtures)
- **Core band** (18 fixtures): fs (7), path (7), process (4)
- **High-value band** (6 fixtures): http (3), crypto (3)
- **Edge band** (3 fixtures): fs (1), path (1), process (1)

### Directory Structure
