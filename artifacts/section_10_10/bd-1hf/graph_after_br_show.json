    "description": "Section: 10.10 — FCP-Inspired Hardening + Interop Integration Track\n\nStrategic Context:\nFCP-inspired hardening/interop contract for IDs, serialization, control-channel auth, revocation freshness, and publication gating.\n\nExecution Requirements:\n- Preserve all scoped capabilities from the canonical plan.\n- Keep contracts self-contained so future contributors can execute without reopening the master plan.\n- Require explicit testing strategy (unit + integration/e2e) and structured logging/telemetry for every child bead.\n- Require artifact-backed validation for performance, security, and correctness claims.\n\nDependency Semantics:\n- This epic is blocked by its child implementation beads.\n- Cross-epic dependencies encode strategic sequencing and canonical ownership boundaries.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All child beads for this section are completed with acceptance artifacts attached and no unresolved blockers.\n- Section-level verification gate for comprehensive unit tests, integration/e2e workflows, and detailed structured logging evidence is green.\n- Scope-to-plan traceability is explicit, with no feature loss versus the canonical plan section.\n\n## Optimization Notes\n- User-Outcome Lens: \"[PLAN 10.10] FCP-Inspired Hardening + Interop Integration Track\" must improve operator confidence, safety posture, and deterministic recovery behavior under both normal and adversarial conditions.\n- Cross-Section Coordination: child beads must encode integration assumptions explicitly to avoid local optimizations that degrade system-wide correctness.\n- Verification Non-Negotiable: completion requires reproducible unit/integration/E2E evidence and structured logs suitable for independent replay.\n- Scope Protection: any simplification must preserve canonical-plan feature intent and be justified with explicit tradeoff documentation.",
