result: failed (exit 101)

notes:
- Patched compile blockers in:
  - crates/franken-node/src/runtime/time_travel.rs (added Debug derive on ReplaySession)
  - crates/franken-node/src/runtime/isolation_mesh.rs (ended mutable workload borrow before push_event)
- No compile errors from those two runtime files appeared in this run.
- Remaining blocking errors were in crates/franken-node/src/registry/staking_governance.rs:
  - E0502 at lines around 1055 and 1056 (mutable borrow while immutable borrow still in scope)

owner_lane:
- staking_governance blocker tracked separately in bead bd-1sim (StormyGate).
