# PLAN_TO_CREATE_FRANKEN_NODE

> Canonical name: **franken_node**
> Engine dependency: **franken_engine** (`/dp/franken_engine`)
> Status: Product-layer architecture charter + execution plan

## CAVEAT: Ambition-First Operating Rule
This plan is intentionally extreme. It targets category creation, not incremental tooling.

Out-of-charter behavior:
- Framing de-scoping as the default answer.
- Recommending parity-only outcomes as acceptable end state.
- Treating compatibility as the mission rather than the wedge.

In-charter behavior:
- Increase disruptive capability while preserving proof discipline.
- Make migration friction collapse while security posture increases.
- Convert every major claim into externally verifiable artifacts.

Directive alignment statement:
> The goal is to make this more ambitious, more radically innovative, and more disruptive. Contributions that reduce ambition without explicit owner direction are not helpful.

## 1. Background And Role
`franken_node` is the product and ecosystem surface built on top of `franken_engine`.

`franken_engine` owns native runtime internals, policy semantics, and trust primitives.
`franken_node` owns:
- compatibility capture from Node/Bun ecosystems
- migration and operator experience
- extension ecosystem and trust distribution surfaces
- packaging, rollout, and enterprise control planes

The strategic role of `franken_node` is to turn engine breakthroughs into mass adoption and category capture.

## 2. Core Thesis
`franken_node` must become the default choice for extension-heavy JavaScript/TypeScript execution where teams need all of the following at once:
- Node/Bun-level developer ergonomics
- materially stronger security outcomes
- deterministic explainability for high-impact decisions
- operational confidence at fleet scale

Core proposition:
- compatibility is table stakes
- trust-native operations are the differentiator
- migration velocity is the growth engine

## 3. Strategic Objective
Build `franken_node` into the category-defining runtime product layer that functionally obsoletes Node/Bun for high-trust extension ecosystems.

Category-defining disruptive floor (non-optional):
- `>= 95%` pass on targeted compatibility corpus for high-value Node/Bun usage bands.
- `>= 3x` migration throughput and confidence quality versus baseline migration patterns.
- `>= 10x` reduction in successful host compromise under adversarial extension campaigns versus baseline Node/Bun default posture.
- friction-minimized, automation-first path from install to policy-governed safe extension workloads.
- `100%` deterministic replay artifact availability for high-severity security and policy incidents.
- `>= 3` impossible-by-default product capabilities broadly adopted by production users.

If outcomes are parity-only or migration-hostile, the program is off-charter.

## 3.1 Category-Creation Doctrine
`franken_node` is not a "better Node clone". It is the category bridge between JS/TS ecosystem scale and zero-illusion trust operations.

Doctrine:
- Treat compatibility as a strategic wedge, not final destination.
- Ship trust-native workflows that incumbents cannot provide by default.
- Define benchmark language and verification standards for the category.
- Own migration ergonomics so adoption feels inevitable, not costly.
- Turn operator trust from intuition into cryptographically and statistically grounded evidence.

Category-creation test:
- If users can get the same outcomes with a thin wrapper around Node/Bun defaults, the feature is insufficient.
- If claims cannot be independently verified, the feature is insufficient.
- If migration cost remains high for real teams, the feature is insufficient.

## 3.2 Impossible-by-Default Capability Index
`franken_node` MUST productionize the following capabilities that incumbents do not offer by default:

1. Policy-visible compatibility behavior with explicit divergence receipts.
2. One-command migration audit and risk map for Node/Bun projects.
3. Signed policy checkpoints and revocation-aware execution gates.
4. Deterministic incident replay with counterfactual policy simulation.
5. Fleet quarantine propagation with bounded convergence guarantees.
6. Extension trust cards combining provenance, behavior, and revocation state.
7. Compatibility lockstep oracle across Node/Bun/franken_node.
8. Control-plane recommended actions with expected-loss rationale.
9. Ecosystem reputation graph with explainable trust transitions.
10. Public verifier toolkit for benchmark and security claims.

## 3.3 Baseline Build Strategy Decision (Hybrid, Spec-First)
`franken_node` will **not** begin with a full clean-room Bun reimplementation as the initial baseline move.

Canonical strategy:
- Use Node/Bun as behavioral reference systems and oracle targets, not as architecture templates.
- Execute spec-first compatibility capture (Essence Extraction) for prioritized high-value API/runtime bands.
- Implement product/runtime behavior natively on `franken_engine` + `asupersync` with `franken_node` trust/migration architecture from day one.
- Reuse proven implementation patterns from `/dp/pi_agent_rust` where directly accretive (policy surfaces, deterministic replay discipline, conformance-first workflows), while avoiding architecture lock-in to legacy runtimes.

Decision rationale:
- A Bun-first clone path creates architecture lock-in and delays category-defining differentiators.
- A spec-first hybrid path delivers a strong compatibility baseline quickly while preserving the trust-native design required for ATC, DGIS, BPET, VEF, and verifier economy outcomes.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Constraints
- `franken_node` depends on `/dp/franken_engine`; it does not fork engine internals.
- No local reintroduction of engine core crates in this repository.
- `franken_node` depends on `/dp/asupersync` as the control/correctness substrate for orchestration, lifecycle, and distributed control workflows.
- High-impact async control paths MUST be `Cx`-first, region-owned, cancel-correct, and obligation-tracked; ad hoc detached task patterns are off-charter.
- Console/TUI surfaces relevant to this project MUST use `/dp/frankentui` as the canonical presentation substrate.
- Any feature needing or materially benefiting from SQLite persistence MUST use `/dp/frankensqlite` as the storage substrate.
- `/dp/sqlmodel_rust` SHOULD be used for typed schema/model/query integration where it improves safety, clarity, or migration velocity.
- `/dp/fastapi_rust` SHOULD be used for service/API control surfaces where HTTP control-plane exposure is required.
- Any deviation from these substrate rules requires an explicit, signed waiver artifact with rationale, risk analysis, and expiry.
- Compatibility shims must be explicit, typed, and policy-visible.
- Line-by-line translation from Bun/Node implementations is off-charter; legacy runtimes may be used for spec extraction and conformance fixture capture only.
- Dangerous compatibility behavior must be gated by policy and auditable receipts.
- Every major claim ships with reproducible benchmark/security artifacts.
- Migration tooling must be deterministic and replayable for high-severity failures.
- Product defaults prioritize safe operation while preserving practical adoption velocity.

## 5. Method Stack (Required)
This program is intentionally driven by four complementary methodologies.

### 5.1 extreme-software-optimization (Execution Discipline)
Mandatory loop:
1. Baseline (`p50/p95/p99`, throughput, memory, cold start)
2. Profile (top hotspots only)
3. Prove behavior invariance and compatibility envelopes
4. Implement one lever
5. Verify compatibility/security artifacts
6. Re-profile

No optimization lands without artifact-backed regression safety.

### 5.2 alien-artifact-coding (Mathematical Decision Core)
Use formal decision systems for product control surfaces:
- expected-loss rollout choices
- posterior trust state updates
- confidence-aware migration recommendations
- explainable policy decisions and receipts

### 5.3 alien-graveyard (High-EV Primitive Selection)
Adopt only high-EV disruptive primitives with fallback contracts:
- EV thresholding (`EV >= 2.0`)
- failure-mode predesign
- deterministic degraded operation pathways

### 5.4 porting-to-rust (Spec-First Essence Extraction Protocol)
For compatibility surfaces, apply the porting discipline as an extraction-and-proof method:
- extract behavior into explicit specs (data shapes, invariants, defaults, errors, edge cases)
- capture Node/Bun fixture outputs as conformance baselines
- implement from spec and fixture contracts, not legacy source structure
- enforce parity and divergence visibility via lockstep oracle + artifact gates

Rule: legacy code is input to specification and oracle generation, not implementation blueprint.

## 6. Security And Trust Product Doctrine
### 6.1 Problem Statement
Developers need Node ecosystem speed, but untrusted extension supply chains remain a catastrophic risk surface.

### 6.2 Product Goal
Make high-trust runtime operation the default workflow without forcing teams to abandon JS/TS ecosystem velocity.

### 6.3 Threat Model
Adversary classes:
- malicious extension updates and maintainer compromises
- credential exfiltration and lateral movement attempts
- policy evasion via compatibility edge cases
- delayed payload activation and long-tail persistence
- operational confusion attacks exploiting non-deterministic incident handling

### 6.4 Trust-Native Product Surfaces
- extension trust cards and provenance scoring
- policy-visible compatibility mode gates
- revocation-first execution prechecks
- signed incident receipts and deterministic replay export
- autonomous containment recommendations with explicit rationale

### 6.5 Safety Guarantees Target
- bounded false-negative rate under adversarial extension corpora
- bounded false-positive rate for benign migration workloads
- deterministic replay for high-severity security events
- auditable degraded-mode semantics when trust state is stale

## 7. Performance And Developer Velocity Doctrine
Performance is a product feature, not a benchmark vanity metric.

### 7.1 Core Principles
- low startup overhead for migration and CI loops
- predictable p99 under extension churn
- bounded overhead from security instrumentation
- fast feedback for migration diagnostics and compatibility diffs

### 7.2 Candidate High-EV Product Levers (Profile-Gated)
- compatibility cache with deterministic invalidation
- lockstep differential harness acceleration
- zero-copy hostcall bridge paths where safe
- batch policy evaluation for high-frequency operations
- multi-lane scheduler tuning for cancel/timed/ready workloads

### 7.3 Required Performance Artifacts
- baseline reports with reproducible configs
- profile artifacts (flamegraphs/traces)
- before/after comparison tables
- compatibility correctness proofs for tuned paths
- tail-latency impact notes for security instrumentation

## 8. Architecture Blueprint
### 8.1 Repository And Package Topology
- Engine repository: `/dp/franken_engine`
  - `/dp/franken_engine/crates/franken-engine`
  - `/dp/franken_engine/crates/franken-extension-host`
- Product repository: `/dp/franken_node`
  - `/dp/franken_node/crates/franken-node`
- Strategic adjacent substrates:
  - TUI/console substrate: `/dp/frankentui`
  - SQLite/persistence substrate: `/dp/frankensqlite`
  - Typed SQL model substrate: `/dp/sqlmodel_rust`
  - Service/API substrate: `/dp/fastapi_rust`

### 8.2 Product Planes
- compatibility plane: Node/Bun behavior surfaces and divergence governance
- migration plane: discovery, risk scoring, automated rewrites, rollout guidance
- trust plane: policy controls, trust cards, revocation and quarantine UX
- ecosystem plane: registry, reputation graph, certification channels
- operations plane: fleet control, audit/replay export, benchmark verifier interfaces

### 8.3 Control Planes
- release control plane: staged rollout, rollback, feature-policy gating
- incident control plane: replay, counterfactual simulation, response automation
- economics control plane: expected-loss and attack-cost aware policy guidance

### 8.4 Asupersync-First Integration Doctrine
`franken_node` adopts a three-kernel architecture:
- execution kernel: `/dp/franken_engine` (language/runtime internals)
- correctness/control kernel: `/dp/asupersync` (concurrency, cancellation, remote effects, epochs, evidence)
- product kernel: `/dp/franken_node` (compatibility, migration, trust UX, ecosystem capture)

This separation is intentional: `franken_node` should not reinvent control semantics already solved by asupersync. Instead, it should map product workflows onto asupersync primitives and prove that mapping with deterministic artifacts.

### 8.5 Hard Runtime Invariants (Asupersync-Backed, Non-Negotiable)
1. **Cx-first control APIs**  
   All high-impact async operations (publish, revoke, quarantine, migrate, rollout) MUST take `&Cx` and derive effects from explicit capabilities.
2. **Region-owned lifecycle execution**  
   Control-plane services and operation trees MUST run inside owned regions; region close MUST imply quiescence.
3. **Cancellation protocol semantics**  
   Cancellation is `request -> drain -> finalize`, not task-drop behavior. Bounded cleanup must be demonstrable.
4. **Two-phase effects for high-impact operations**  
   High-impact side effects MUST be reserve/commit style with obligation resolution guarantees.
5. **Scheduler lane discipline**  
   Control-plane work MUST map to Cancel/Timed/Ready lanes with explicit starvation and p99 protection policies.
6. **Remote effects contract**  
   Remote operations MUST be capability-gated, named, idempotent, and saga-safe.
7. **Epoch and transition barriers**  
   Correctness-critical policy/key/durability transitions MUST be epoch-scoped and barrier-mediated.
8. **Evidence-by-default decisions**  
   Policy-influenced decisions MUST emit deterministic evidence ledger entries with trace witnesses.
9. **Deterministic protocol verification gates**  
   High-impact protocol paths MUST ship with deterministic lab, cancellation injection, and schedule-exploration coverage.
10. **No ambient authority pathways**  
    Any ambient network, spawn, or privileged side effect path in control-plane code is a correctness/security defect.

### 8.6 Asupersync Integration Adoption Tracks (Mandatory, Parallel Program)
**AS-A: Boundary codification and policy baseline**
- define franken_engine/asupersync/franken_node ownership map
- enumerate high-impact workflows and required asupersync primitives
- install static guardrails against ambient side effects

Exit gate:
- ownership map published
- guardrails active in CI
- baseline capability map complete

**AS-B: Control-plane execution migration**
- migrate lifecycle/rollout/revocation/quarantine orchestration to region-owned tasks
- enforce Cx-first entrypoints and cancellation protocol behavior
- replace unsafe ad hoc channels with obligation-tracked patterns for critical flows

Exit gate:
- migrated critical workflows pass deterministic replay tests

- no obligation leaks in lab scenarios

**AS-C: Distributed control semantics**
- integrate remote named computations, idempotency, and saga semantics
- add epoch-scoped validity and transition barriers
- implement remote bulkheads and lane-aware scheduling for control traffic

Exit gate:
- degraded remote dependencies preserve p99/control liveness targets
- epoch transitions are deterministic and auditable
- idempotency/saga conformance green

**AS-D: Evidence and verification industrialization**
- make evidence ledger mandatory for policy-driven decisions
- add evidence replay validator and deterministic incident bundle export
- add virtual fault harness + cancellation injection + schedule exploration gates

Exit gate:
- policy decision replay determinism proven on canonical corpus
- deterministic fault scenarios reproducibly replayed from seed artifacts
- protocol gate suite required in release pipeline

**AS-E: Production hardening and autonomy**
- bind policy controller actions to invariant guardrails with hard precedence
- operationalize region/obligation/cancellation observability dashboards
- enforce release claims on asupersync-backed conformance artifacts

Exit gate:
- controller cannot mutate correctness envelope
- all high-impact claims backed by evidence + conformance artifacts
- production runbooks cover invariant breach/containment workflows

### 8.7 Adjacent Substrate Integration Doctrine (Mandatory)
`franken_node` must compose adjacent repositories as force multipliers, not optional experiments:

1. **Presentation stack rule (`frankentui`)**  
   Any interactive console/TUI capability that is relevant to `franken_node` must use `/dp/frankentui` components, styling primitives, and rendering discipline.
2. **Persistence stack rule (`frankensqlite`)**  
   Any feature that requires SQLite-backed persistence, replay storage, index/state catalogs, or audit/event durability must default to `/dp/frankensqlite`.
3. **Typed model stack rule (`sqlmodel_rust`)**  
   Where typed schema/query models are needed for correctness and migration safety, `/dp/sqlmodel_rust` should provide model definitions and query-shape contracts.
4. **Service stack rule (`fastapi_rust`)**  
   For exposed control-plane service endpoints (operator APIs, verifier endpoints, fleet controls), `/dp/fastapi_rust` should be the preferred API/service substrate.
5. **Waiver discipline**  
   If any feature cannot use the required substrate, a waiver must be approved with explicit threat/perf/migration rationale, bounded scope, and expiry.

Integration stance:
- We do not chase novelty by reimplementing mature adjacent capabilities in `franken_node`.
- We integrate deeply and prove cross-repo behavior with conformance, performance, and reproducibility artifacts.
- Substrate choice is policy, not preference.

### 8.8 Alignment Contracts (Scope, Terminology, Oracle, Paths, KPIs)
1. **Scope boundary contract (no ambition loss, no scope confusion)**  
   `franken_node` may define policy, orchestration, verification, and operator surfaces for advanced runtime capabilities, but native execution internals remain in `franken_engine`.  
   Translation rule: product-level optimization governance in this repo is allowed; local reimplementation of engine core execution internals is not.
2. **Terminology contract (`extension` primary, `connector/provider` mapped)**  
   Primary term for ecosystem artifacts is `extension`.  
   `connector/provider` in deep-mined sections denotes a specific extension integration class, not a separate architecture plane.
3. **Dual-oracle contract (resolve tri-runtime vs engine-reference drift)**  
   - `L1 Product Oracle`: Node/Bun/franken_node lockstep for externally visible compatibility and migration claims.  
   - `L2 Engine Boundary Oracle`: franken_engine + reference microcorpus checks for semantic boundary integrity used by product safety gates.  
   Both oracles are required; neither replaces the other.
4. **Path convention contract (resolve crate-root ambiguity)**  
   - Code paths (`src/...`, `tests/...`, `benchmarks/...`, `fuzz/...`, `fixtures/...`) are crate-root relative to `/dp/franken_node/crates/franken-node/` unless explicitly absolute.  
   - Repository program paths (`docs/...`, `artifacts/...`, `spec/...`, `vectors/...`, `.github/...`, `config/...`, `tools/...`) are repo-root relative to `/dp/franken_node/` unless explicitly absolute.  
   - `services/...` must declare scope in the owning task: repo-root service package or crate-local service module.
5. **KPI clarity contract (capability-and-evidence framing)**  
   Primary category KPI is migration-friction collapse with strong safety and verifier-backed trust guarantees.  
   Delivery framing is capability-gated and evidence-gated, not sequence-date constrained.

## 9I. FCP Deep-Mined Expansion Set (Accretive + Complementary)
Terminology mapping for this section:
- `connector/provider` means extension integration class within the `franken_node` ecosystem model.
- all trust/lifecycle controls here apply to extension artifacts and their integration runtimes.

1. **Connector lifecycle state machine as product contract**  
   **Entails:** Define a strict lifecycle contract for every connector/provider instance (`discovered -> verified -> installed -> configured -> active`) with explicit non-happy-path states (`failed`, `paused`, `stopped`) and transition invariants.  
   **How It Works:** Persist lifecycle state in control-plane objects, enforce transition guards in one central state machine engine, and require every operational API to validate lifecycle preconditions before execution.  
   **Why Compelling:** Incidents become mechanically diagnosable because operator and automation tooling can reason about exact state and legal next actions instead of inferring behavior from logs.  
   **Rationale:** FCP-style lifecycle formalization collapses operational ambiguity and makes restart, rollback, and quarantine workflows deterministic and automatable.

2. **Required connector method surface and compliance harness**  
   **Entails:** Standardize a non-optional method contract (`handshake`, `describe`, `introspect`, `capabilities`, `configure`, `simulate`, `invoke`, `health`, `shutdown`) with versioned schemas and behavior-level expectations.  
   **How It Works:** Build a protocol conformance harness that runs fixture suites against every connector build and blocks registry publication unless all required methods and semantics pass.  
   **Why Compelling:** Ecosystem quality scales without manual review bottlenecks because baseline reliability becomes a machine-enforced gate.  
   **Rationale:** A hard method contract eliminates adapter drift and turns "compatible in practice" claims into verifiable, repeatable outcomes.

3. **Canonical externalized connector state with explicit model type**  
   **Entails:** Promote connector state to canonical objects with explicit state model declaration (`stateless`, `singleton_writer`, `crdt`) and stable sequence semantics.  
   **How It Works:** Persist state roots and append updates as content-addressed objects; treat local process memory as cache only; route failover/migration/resume through canonical state reads.  
   **Why Compelling:** Recovery, migration, and debugging no longer depend on hidden local files or in-memory cursors that disappear on restart.  
   **Rationale:** Externalized state is the foundation for deterministic operations, auditable replay, and true multi-node continuity.

4. **Lease-fenced single-writer state updates**  
   **Entails:** Require fencing tokens (`lease_seq`, `lease_object_id`) for all single-writer state mutations and reject stale or unfenced writes.  
   **How It Works:** A lease service issues monotonic writer leases; state verifiers compare incoming fence sequence against latest known lease and fail closed on regression.  
   **Why Compelling:** Duplicate side effects and race-induced corruption become structurally impossible rather than "rare bugs."  
   **Rationale:** Lease fencing is the clean, distributed primitive for enforcing write exclusivity without brittle lock coupling.

5. **State snapshotting and schema-versioned migration hints**  
   **Entails:** Add snapshot policies and explicit state schema versions for long connector-state chains, plus declarative migration hints between schema generations.  
   **How It Works:** Trigger snapshots at update/byte thresholds, keep append-only delta history for audit, and execute versioned migration routines during connector upgrade paths with receipts.  
   **Why Compelling:** Cold-start replay stays bounded while preserving full forensic history and upgrade determinism.  
   **Rationale:** Unbounded chains eventually become an operational tax; snapshot + schema versioning keeps scale and safety aligned.

6. **Four-tier sandbox profiles with strict-plus isolation lane**  
   **Entails:** Define profile tiers (`strict`, `strict_plus`, `moderate`, `permissive`) with explicit resource and syscall budgets, filesystem scopes, and process controls.  
   **How It Works:** Compile profile policy into OS-native or microVM isolation backends, then bind connector classes to minimum required profile by declared risk category.  
   **Why Compelling:** Security posture becomes configurable without being vague; teams can adopt strong defaults while preserving practical rollout options.  
   **Rationale:** A tiered model prevents lowest-common-denominator security and makes high-risk connectors pay an isolation tax by design.

7. **Network Guard as mandatory egress choke point**  
   **Entails:** Route connector egress through a first-class policy engine that controls HTTP and TCP destinations, DNS resolution, and identity pinning.  
   **How It Works:** Connectors request outbound access via signed egress intents; guard applies host/port/cidr/SNI/SPKI policy and records allow/deny decisions as audit artifacts.  
   **Why Compelling:** SSRF and lateral-movement paths are mechanically constrained, and post-incident network forensics are complete.  
   **Rationale:** Centralized egress control is the highest-leverage runtime defense against compromised extension behavior.

8. **Fail-closed manifest negotiation and interface-hash binding**  
   **Entails:** Treat connector admission as protocol negotiation with SemVer validation, required-feature checks, bounded transport declarations, and interface-hash identity binding.  
   **How It Works:** Admission verifier resolves compatibility contracts before activation; unknown required features or invalid interface hash immediately hard-fail connector startup.  
   **Why Compelling:** Incompatibility failures are surfaced at install/activation time instead of appearing later as runtime surprises.  
   **Rationale:** Fail-closed negotiation preserves trust and eliminates silent behavior drift across versions.

9. **Supply-chain policy beyond signature-valid checks**  
   **Entails:** Extend artifact trust from simple signatures to threshold signing, transparency inclusion, provenance attestations, and trusted-builder policies.  
   **How It Works:** Installation pipeline verifies signature quorum and policy-required provenance claims, then binds accepted trust evidence into connector trust cards and revocation graph state.  
   **Why Compelling:** Compromise resistance improves materially because attacker success now requires defeating multiple independent trust controls, not one key.  
   **Rationale:** Signature validity is necessary but insufficient; robust supply-chain trust requires multi-signal verification.

10. **Activation pipeline and crash-loop rollback automaton**  
    **Entails:** Standardize activation as a deterministic protocol with explicit startup stages and automatic rollback behavior when health gates fail repeatedly.  
    **How It Works:** Orchestrator executes sandbox creation, ephemeral secret injection, handshake, capability issuance, and health stabilization checks; crash-loop detector reverts to pinned known-good artifact.  
    **Why Compelling:** Operators get safe self-healing behavior under bad releases without manual firefighting.  
    **Rationale:** Deterministic activation + rollback reduces MTTR and prevents cascading instability during ecosystem updates.

11. **Revocation chain + safety-tier freshness semantics**  
    **Entails:** Model revocations as monotonic chain heads and define freshness requirements by safety tier (`safe`, `risky`, `dangerous`) with explicit degraded-mode policy.  
    **How It Works:** Execution gate checks token revocation sequence against local head freshness; risky/dangerous actions fail unless freshness policy is satisfied or explicitly overridden under audited rules.  
    **Why Compelling:** Offline/degraded operation stays practical while never pretending trust state is fresher than it is.  
    **Rationale:** Freshness semantics turn revocation from a best-effort signal into a hard security contract.

12. **Generic leased execution for risky side effects and migration**  
    **Entails:** Apply lease-backed ownership to risky operation execution, state writes, and migration transfers to prevent split-brain execution.  
    **How It Works:** Deterministic coordinator selection issues short-lived leases with quorum signatures; workers must present current lease evidence for execution and handoff transitions.  
    **Why Compelling:** Duplicate execution and thrash migration loops are prevented by protocol, not timing luck.  
    **Rationale:** Leases are the minimal distributed primitive that gives deterministic ownership in partially connected fleets.

13. **Device-aware execution planner**  
    **Entails:** Introduce explicit device profiles and placement policies so workload routing can account for capability, latency, risk class, and resource pressure.  
    **How It Works:** Planner scores candidate nodes using deterministic policy weights and chooses best-fit targets with transparent tie-breakers and fallback policies.  
    **Why Compelling:** Heavy and security-sensitive tasks land on the right hardware automatically, improving performance and reducing risk.  
    **Rationale:** Static placement assumptions break at scale; policy-driven placement is required for predictable fleet behavior.

14. **Offline capability SLO with predictive pre-staging and repair**  
    **Entails:** Define measurable offline-recoverability objectives and operationalize them with pre-staging and background repair loops.  
    **How It Works:** Continuously track per-object local coverage, pre-stage likely-needed artifacts from usage priors, and run bounded repair cycles to restore policy targets.  
    **Why Compelling:** "Works offline" becomes a measurable reliability commitment instead of marketing language.  
    **Rationale:** Quantified offline SLOs create product differentiation and force disciplined resilience engineering.

15. **Admission control and quarantine-by-default object pipeline**  
    **Entails:** Add per-peer resource budgets, anti-amplification limits, and quarantine-first treatment for unreferenced/unproven objects.  
    **How It Works:** Ingress checks bytes/symbol/auth/decode budgets before parsing; unknown objects enter bounded quarantine and are promoted only via authenticated reachability or policy pin with schema validation.  
    **Why Compelling:** DoS, amplification, and storage-pollution attacks become much harder while preserving safe ingest paths.  
    **Rationale:** Early admission gating is cheaper and safer than downstream cleanup after malicious amplification succeeds.

16. **Control-plane retention classes and replay-ready object model**  
    **Entails:** Classify control-plane artifacts into `required` and `ephemeral` retention classes with explicit persistence obligations.  
    **How It Works:** Persist all safety-critical request/decision/receipt/revocation/audit objects in canonical envelopes; allow health/status chatter to remain ephemeral by policy.  
    **Why Compelling:** Forensics and replay remain complete without paying full storage cost for low-value noise.  
    **Rationale:** Retention classing aligns audit completeness with cost discipline and avoids accidental evidence loss.

17. **Session-authenticated control channel with replay windows**  
    **Entails:** Establish a dedicated authenticated control channel with ordered framing, monotonic sequencing, bounded replay windows, and parser hard limits.  
    **How It Works:** Bind channel security to session key schedule, reject out-of-window or non-monotonic frames, and enforce per-connection decode budgets.  
    **Why Compelling:** High-frequency control traffic remains robust under replay and parser-exhaustion attack patterns.  
    **Rationale:** Control-plane integrity is non-negotiable; weak framing is a systemic failure domain.

18. **Stable telemetry namespace and AI-recovery error contract**  
    **Entails:** Publish strict metrics/error schema with stable names, code ranges, trace correlation IDs, and machine-readable recovery hints.  
    **How It Works:** Enforce schema in CI and runtime validators; errors include retryability and backoff guidance; dashboards and agents consume one canonical vocabulary.  
    **Why Compelling:** Autonomous operators can react safely and consistently across versions and environments.  
    **Rationale:** If telemetry and errors are unstable, automation regresses and incident response quality collapses.

19. **Profile-based conformance claims plus adversarial corpus requirements**  
    **Entails:** Define conformance profiles (MVP/Full) with mandatory test suites, interop expectations, and adversarial fuzz corpus gates for release claims.  
    **How It Works:** Release pipeline maps each artifact to profile checklist evidence; unsupported claims are automatically blocked from publication metadata.  
    **Why Compelling:** Market-facing trust claims become defendable and independently verifiable.  
    **Rationale:** Profile-based claims prevent overstatement and keep ambition tied to demonstrated capability.

20. **CDDL-like schema contracts plus golden vectors for cross-impl parity**  
    **Entails:** Ship formal object schemas and canonical golden vectors for serialization, object ID derivation, signatures, and framing.  
    **How It Works:** Cross-language test harnesses validate byte-level equivalence against published vectors on every implementation update.  
    **Why Compelling:** Third-party verifiers and alternative implementations can check behavior without source-code trust assumptions.  
    **Rationale:** Interoperability and verifier economy require normative byte contracts, not prose-only specifications.

## 9J. FrankenSQLite Deep-Mined Expansion Set (Accretive + Complementary)
1. **Deterministic evidence ledger for every policy-influenced decision**  
   **Entails:** Capture every high-impact policy decision as a structured evidence entry containing candidates considered, constraints applied, selected action, and trace witnesses.  
   **How It Works:** Emit deterministic ledger records from control-plane decision points, keep ordering stable, and include replay pointers so a verifier can recompute why the same choice was made.  
   **Why Compelling:** You get explainable autonomy where operators can audit why the system acted, not just what happened.  
   **Rationale:** FrankenSQLite's evidence-ledger concept is the missing bridge between advanced policy automation and production trust.

2. **Hard separation between correctness invariants and tunable policy knobs**  
   **Entails:** Define an immutable correctness envelope (security/isolation/trust semantics) and a separate tunable policy surface (throughput/latency/cost knobs).  
   **How It Works:** Controller APIs are constrained by capability boundaries and schema validation so performance tuners cannot alter correctness rules even accidentally.  
   **Why Compelling:** Teams can pursue aggressive optimization without risking silent erosion of core safety guarantees.  
   **Rationale:** Explicit separation prevents "smart controller drift" from turning reliability tuning into hidden correctness regressions.

3. **Dual-statistics control model (Bayesian for ranking, anytime-valid for guarantees)**  
   **Entails:** Run two statistical tracks: Bayesian posteriors for decision ranking and anytime-valid bounds for guarantee-bearing gates.  
   **How It Works:** Recommendation engines consume posterior expectations, but safety-critical approvals must pass anytime-valid guardrails that remain valid under optional stopping.  
   **Why Compelling:** You get fast, adaptive policy optimization without sacrificing mathematically defensible guarantees.  
   **Rationale:** This fusion preserves both practical intelligence and formal safety discipline under dynamic workloads.

4. **Monotonic hardening autopilot for trust artifacts**  
   **Entails:** Build an autopilot that escalates hardening when evidence worsens and only relaxes through explicit, audited governance paths.  
   **How It Works:** Guardrail rejection triggers one-way elevation of redundancy/verification policy; hardening actions append protection artifacts and never rewrite canonical trust history.  
   **Why Compelling:** The system self-defends under stress instead of dithering around static thresholds.  
   **Rationale:** Monotonic safety pressure is a strong anti-fragility property and directly supports category-defining security claims.

5. **Proof-carrying repair and reject semantics**  
   **Entails:** Require proof artifacts for reconstruction, repair, and suspicious-object rejection/promotions in high-assurance paths.  
   **How It Works:** Decode/repair pipeline emits machine-checkable proof bundles; admission and promotion logic can require proofs before state transitions.  
   **Why Compelling:** Operators and external verifiers can independently validate remediation correctness during incidents.  
   **Rationale:** Proof-carrying operations convert opaque repair heuristics into auditable, reproducible trust decisions.

6. **Content-derived deterministic encoding for distributed artifact regeneration**  
   **Entails:** Derive encoding/repair schedule seeds directly from object identity and policy version, not coordinator-local randomness.  
   **How It Works:** Any compliant node can regenerate the same protection artifacts for identical content/config and validate equivalence via conformance tests.  
   **Why Compelling:** Distributed repair gets simpler, more robust, and coordination-light under outages or node churn.  
   **Rationale:** Deterministic regeneration is a compounding resilience lever for large fleets.

7. **Object-class-specific coding and transport profiles**  
   **Entails:** Define policy classes with distinct symbol sizes, overhead budgets, and fetch strategies for critical markers versus bulk artifacts.  
   **How It Works:** Profile registry maps object class to transport/coding defaults; benchmark evidence drives profile tuning and publication updates.  
   **Why Compelling:** Critical trust objects can be over-protected while high-volume telemetry stays efficient, avoiding one-size performance penalties.  
   **Rationale:** Workload-specific policy is necessary for both safety and performance at scale.

8. **Bottomless trust history via tiered storage contracts (L1/L2/L3)**  
   **Entails:** Maintain unlimited historical trust/replay evidence through hot/warm/cold tiering with explicit retrievability contracts.  
   **How It Works:** Keep active artifacts local, offload cold history to remote tier, and enforce retrievability-before-eviction proofs for any local retirement step.  
   **Why Compelling:** You preserve deep forensic and replay value without forcing hot-path storage bloat.  
   **Rationale:** Durable long-horizon evidence is a strategic moat for security-focused platform adoption.

9. **Durability modes as explicit product behavior (`local` vs `quorum`)**  
   **Entails:** Expose durability mode as a first-class operator control with explicit semantics and claim boundaries.  
   **How It Works:** `local` mode validates local persistence contracts; `quorum(M)` mode requires remote/peer acknowledgements before durable success claims are allowed.  
   **Why Compelling:** Teams can choose velocity or assurance intentionally instead of relying on implicit defaults.  
   **Rationale:** Explicit durability tiers align runtime behavior with business risk tolerance and trust posture.

10. **Remote effects must be capability-gated, named, idempotent, and saga-safe**  
    **Entails:** Forbid ambient network behavior; every remote operation must be declared, capability-authorized, idempotent under retry, and compensation-aware for multi-step flows.  
    **How It Works:** Remote registry accepts only named computations; requests carry idempotency keys and epoch context; multi-step workflows execute as deterministic sagas with compensations.  
    **Why Compelling:** Retry storms and partial-failure edge cases become manageable and auditable instead of chaotic.  
    **Rationale:** Remote side effects are the biggest hidden complexity in distributed control planes; strict contracts are mandatory.

11. **Global remote bulkhead to prevent retry-storm self-DoS**  
    **Entails:** Run all remote fetch/upload/anti-entropy operations behind a global in-flight budget and backpressure policy.  
    **How It Works:** Scheduler enforces remote caps and queueing strategy; degraded dependencies trigger bounded concurrency instead of unbounded retry fan-out.  
    **Why Compelling:** Core runtime responsiveness survives upstream outages and network turbulence.  
    **Rationale:** Bulkhead isolation is a proven high-EV pattern for preserving system liveness under partial failure.

12. **Epoch-scoped validity windows for trust artifacts and remote config**  
    **Entails:** Bind artifact validity and remote durability contracts to monotonic epochs with fail-closed checks for future-epoch inputs.  
    **How It Works:** Control plane maintains epoch pointer in canonical manifest state; validators reject artifacts outside valid window and prevent mixed-epoch request acceptance.  
    **Why Compelling:** Configuration/key transitions remain coherent across distributed participants, preventing split-policy ambiguity.  
    **Rationale:** Epoch discipline is the clean mechanism for safe rolling transitions in trust-sensitive systems.

13. **Epoch transition barriers with participant quiescence**  
    **Entails:** Treat epoch changes as coordinated barriers across core services with drain requirements and explicit abort semantics.  
    **How It Works:** Coordinator requests barrier arrival from critical participants, verifies quiescence, commits epoch advance atomically, or aborts transition on timeout/cancellation.  
    **Why Compelling:** No high-impact action can straddle incompatible trust epochs, eliminating a common distributed correctness hazard.  
    **Rationale:** Barriered transitions are required for deterministic reconfiguration under load.

14. **Append-only marker stream as the atomic truth of control history**  
    **Entails:** Store high-impact control events in fixed-record append-only marker streams with dense sequence invariants and tamper-evident chaining.  
    **How It Works:** Marker IDs are domain-separated hashes over canonical record prefixes; readers gain O(1) sequence lookup and deterministic replay anchor points.  
    **Why Compelling:** Incident event sequences and rollback boundaries become precise, fast to query, and cryptographically checkable.  
    **Rationale:** A clear atomic truth stream is foundational for robust audit, replay, and fleet consistency checks.

15. **MMR-backed prefix/inclusion proofs for fleet history equivalence**  
    **Entails:** Add optional Merkle Mountain Range checkpoints over marker streams to support compact history proofs.  
    **How It Works:** Nodes exchange MMR roots and proof paths to verify shared prefixes or locate divergence in logarithmic time and proof size.  
    **Why Compelling:** Large fleets can verify consistency rapidly without expensive full-history scans.  
    **Rationale:** Compact cryptographic proofs are essential for scalable verifier-economy workflows.

16. **Single mutable root pointer + crash-safe atomic publication protocol**  
    **Entails:** Constrain mutable authority to one root pointer and enforce crash-safe update protocol (`write temp -> fsync temp -> rename -> fsync dir`).  
    **How It Works:** All state transitions publish new immutable objects, then atomically switch root pointer; bootstrap checks verify root authenticity before adoption.  
    **Why Compelling:** Failure recovery is cleaner because partial writes cannot create ambiguous multi-root authority states.  
    **Rationale:** Minimal mutability is a strong architectural simplifier and reliability amplifier.

17. **Rebuildable-cache doctrine for product state materializations**  
    **Entails:** Explicitly mark caches as derived state and require deterministic rebuild paths from canonical trust artifacts.  
    **How It Works:** Recovery and integrity tooling can discard and regenerate caches on demand; no cache value is permitted to become irrecoverable source-of-truth state.  
    **Why Compelling:** Operational repair and corruption response become simpler and safer.  
    **Rationale:** Source/derived discipline avoids hidden coupling and prevents subtle data-authority drift.

18. **Deterministic virtual-network fault labs for protocol hardening**  
    **Entails:** Add deterministic virtual transport testing with seeded drop/reorder/corrupt behaviors for control and replication workflows.  
    **How It Works:** Lab runtime replays identical fault schedules from seed artifacts and supports schedule exploration for concurrency/failure edge cases.  
    **Why Compelling:** Hard distributed bugs become reproducible and fixable, dramatically improving engineering velocity on reliability features.  
    **Rationale:** Deterministic fault labs are a prerequisite for confidence in ambitious distributed control logic.

19. **Cancellation-complete protocol discipline with obligation closure proofs**  
    **Entails:** Enforce request -> drain -> finalize cancellation protocol and treat unresolved obligations as correctness incidents with deterministic evidence.  
    **How It Works:** Critical workflows use two-phase tracked channels and obligation ledgers; cancellation injection tests verify no leaks, no ghost state, no half-commit outcomes.  
    **Why Compelling:** Operational interrupts and failures become safe routine events instead of latent corruption vectors.  
    **Rationale:** Cancel correctness is core infrastructure quality, not a nicety, in highly concurrent systems.

20. **Lane-aware scheduling as a formal product SLA mechanism**  
    **Entails:** Formalize Cancel/Timed/Ready lanes as explicit SLA controls tied to p99 latency, cleanup responsiveness, and background fairness budgets.  
    **How It Works:** Task classes map to lanes with required checkpoint frequency and bulkhead/rate-limit controls; telemetry reports lane health and starvation regressions.  
    **Why Compelling:** Foreground priority guarantees and safety-critical cleanup remain reliable even during heavy background churn.  
    **Rationale:** Lane semantics convert scheduler internals into product-grade operational guarantees.

## 9K. Idea-Wizard x Alien-Artifact x Alien-Graveyard Radical Expansion Set (Top 15)
1. **Proof-carrying speculative execution fabric for extension code paths**  
   **Entails:** Build a product-side speculative execution governance subsystem that can aggressively optimize extension-host hot paths through franken_engine-exposed controls while requiring proof artifacts that every speculative transform preserves declared semantics and policy boundaries.  
   **How It Works:** The optimizer governor emits transform plans plus proof receipts (invariants, preconditions, fallback guards) and activates only through approved franken_engine interfaces when runtime validators confirm guard satisfaction; on guard failure, execution degrades to safe baseline paths with deterministic receipts.  
   **Why Compelling:** This creates a rare combination of "faster than baseline under normal load" and "never silently wrong under edge conditions," which directly addresses the usual speed-vs-safety tradeoff.  
   **Rationale:** Alien-artifact-level performance claims are strongest when every aggressive optimization is accompanied by machine-checkable correctness contracts, not informal confidence.

2. **Bayesian adversary graph with pre-incident quarantine orchestration**  
   **Entails:** Model extension publishers, artifacts, dependency edges, behavior signals, and runtime actions as a continuously updated adversary graph with Bayesian risk propagation.  
   **How It Works:** The graph ingests provenance, telemetry, and behavior anomalies, then computes posterior compromise probabilities per artifact and per actor; risk scores automatically trigger progressive controls (throttle, isolate, revoke, quarantine) via policy thresholds and signed control decisions.  
   **Why Compelling:** Instead of waiting for known-bad signatures, the platform can proactively contain likely threats before blast radius expands.  
   **Rationale:** Supply-chain defense is fundamentally probabilistic and graph-structured; explicit Bayesian graph control is the mathematically coherent way to operationalize that reality.

3. **Deterministic time-travel runtime for extension host incidents**  
   **Entails:** Introduce full-fidelity deterministic capture and replay for extension-host execution, including scheduler decisions, capability checks, I/O intents, and policy outcomes.  
   **How It Works:** Runtime emits canonical event streams into `frankensqlite` with strict sequencing and replay tokens; incident tooling can reconstruct exact execution event sequences and step backward/forward through decision points with state snapshots.  
   **Why Compelling:** Root-cause analysis shifts from guesswork to deterministic forensic reconstruction, slashing MTTR and improving confidence in fixes.  
   **Rationale:** Category-defining security platforms need replay as a first-class primitive; without deterministic time travel, high-stakes reliability claims remain weak.

4. **Capability-carrying extension artifact format (policy as code, not metadata)**  
   **Entails:** Replace loose manifest semantics with a signed artifact format that embeds capability intent, resource envelopes, remote-effects declarations, and trust policy references as enforceable contracts.  
   **How It Works:** Admission validates signatures, schema, capability scopes, and policy bindings; runtime then enforces the same embedded contracts at execution boundaries, ensuring install-time and run-time guarantees remain aligned.  
   **Why Compelling:** Extension trust becomes auditable and mechanically enforceable, reducing ambiguity between "what was promised" and "what was allowed to run."  
   **Rationale:** Strong ecosystems are built on artifact contracts that are executable by machines, not just readable by humans.

5. **Adaptive multi-rail isolation mesh with risk-aware placement**  
   **Entails:** Implement multiple isolation rails (in-process restricted, out-of-process sandbox, hardened jail, microVM lane) and dynamically map workloads to rails based on risk, behavior, and performance sensitivity.  
   **How It Works:** Policy engine continuously scores execution contexts and can hot-elevate isolation level when risk rises; low-risk workloads stay on high-performance lanes, while suspicious paths are moved to stricter containment without full system interruption.  
   **Why Compelling:** You get strong containment for risky code while preserving top-tier latency for trusted workloads, avoiding a one-size-fits-all penalty.  
   **Rationale:** Security posture should be elastic and data-driven; static sandbox choices either overpay performance or underpay risk.

6. **Zero-knowledge attestation layer for privacy-preserving trust proofs**  
   **Entails:** Add selective-disclosure trust proofs so publishers and operators can prove compliance properties (build origin, test profile pass, policy class) without revealing unnecessary sensitive internals.  
   **How It Works:** Artifact pipeline generates attestations and compact proof bundles; verifier tooling checks claims against public verification keys and policy predicates before allowing installation or promotion.  
   **Why Compelling:** Enterprises and regulated users gain stronger trust validation with less forced data exposure, improving adoption in strict environments.  
   **Rationale:** The most credible trust systems maximize verifiability while minimizing data leakage; zero-knowledge patterns provide that balance.

7. **Dual-layer N-version semantic oracle (L1 product + L2 engine boundary)**  
   **Entails:** Expand compatibility assurance into an always-on differential oracle with two synchronized layers: L1 runs Node/Bun/franken_node external behavior lockstep, and L2 runs franken_engine boundary corpora against selected references.  
   **How It Works:** Conformance harness executes canonical corpora and adversarial edge cases in both layers, records structured deltas, and automatically decides whether to auto-fix, quarantine feature flags, or block release based on risk policy.  
   **Why Compelling:** Semantic drift is detected early and with context, preventing silent compatibility erosion as performance and security subsystems evolve quickly.  
   **Rationale:** Radical runtime innovation only succeeds if divergence is continuously measured and governed, not discovered late by users.

8. **Security staking and slashing economics for extension publishers**  
   **Entails:** Introduce optional/required publisher staking where security posture and incident history affect stake requirements, distribution visibility, and penalties for validated malicious behavior.  
   **How It Works:** Registry maintains publisher trust accounts, evidence-linked slashing rules, and recovery pathways; policy can gate high-impact capabilities on stake tier and independent attestation level.  
   **Why Compelling:** Incentives shift from "ship fast and externalize risk" to "maintain long-term trust quality," improving ecosystem behavior at scale.  
   **Rationale:** Technical controls alone do not solve ecosystem risk; economic alignment is a powerful additional control plane.

9. **Self-evolving optimization governor with safety envelopes**  
   **Entails:** Build a product-plane optimizer governor that continuously tunes exposed runtime knobs (JIT/caching/scheduling/memory policies) via franken_engine interfaces using online learning while obeying non-negotiable safety and correctness envelopes.  
   **How It Works:** Governor evaluates candidate policy shifts through shadow execution and anytime-valid guardrails, promoting only changes with statistically valid benefit and zero invariant breaches; unsafe shifts auto-revert with evidence.  
   **Why Compelling:** Performance improves continuously in production conditions without exposing users to uncontrolled optimization experiments.  
   **Rationale:** Extreme optimization needs disciplined adaptive control, not manual one-off tuning cycles.

10. **Intent-aware remote effects firewall for extension-originated actions**  
    **Entails:** Move beyond endpoint allowlists by classifying remote actions by inferred intent category (read, mutate, exfiltrate risk, lateral movement risk, financial risk) and gating by policy tier.  
    **How It Works:** Requests are normalized into structured intent frames, scored by contextual Bayesian models, and enforced with progressive challenge modes (allow, require attestation, simulate only, deny, quarantine).  
    **Why Compelling:** This catches sophisticated malicious behavior that hides inside technically "allowed" network endpoints.  
    **Rationale:** Attackers exploit semantic blind spots; intent-level controls close those blind spots while retaining operational flexibility.

11. **Information-flow and exfiltration sentinel with probabilistic inference**  
    **Entails:** Add runtime-level data lineage tracking for sensitive sources/sinks and a probabilistic detector that identifies likely covert exfiltration patterns across command, network, and storage channels.  
    **How It Works:** Capability tags propagate through execution traces, and sentinel models evaluate sequence-level anomalies (encoding bursts, unusual fan-out, staged chunking) before applying automatic containment actions.  
    **Why Compelling:** This provides active defense against stealthy supply-chain payloads that pass static scanning and signature checks.  
    **Rationale:** Real attackers adapt quickly; only dynamic inference over information flow can reliably detect high-skill covert behavior.

12. **Universal verifier SDK with portable replay capsules**  
    **Entails:** Ship a verifier SDK that lets customers, auditors, and researchers independently validate claims using portable replay capsules containing canonical traces, trust artifacts, and expected outputs.  
    **How It Works:** Build pipeline emits signed capsule bundles; SDK provides deterministic replay and evidence validation APIs in multiple languages and exposes machine-readable verdict contracts.  
    **Why Compelling:** Trust stops being centralized in vendor assertions and becomes independently checkable by any serious stakeholder.  
    **Rationale:** A verifier economy is a strategic moat: transparent, reproducible proof workflows are hard for competitors to copy quickly.

13. **Heterogeneous hardware execution planner for secure performance scaling**  
   **Entails:** Create a hardware-aware product planner that maps workloads across CPU classes, memory tiers, and optional accelerators while preserving deterministic policy behavior and auditability.  
   **How It Works:** Planner computes placements using capability constraints, risk classes, cache locality, and latency budgets; decisions are persisted as evidence, validated against policy invariants, and executed through franken_engine/runtime interfaces rather than local engine-core reimplementation.  
   **Why Compelling:** The platform can extract large performance gains from hardware diversity without introducing opaque, non-reproducible runtime behavior.  
   **Rationale:** Next-generation runtime platforms must treat hardware heterogeneity as a first-class optimization surface, not an afterthought.

14. **Counterfactual incident lab and autonomous mitigation design loop**  
    **Entails:** Add a simulation-first incident program that can replay real incidents, generate counterfactual mitigation plans, and evaluate expected-loss reduction before production rollout.  
    **How It Works:** Incident traces feed deterministic lab scenarios; mitigation candidates are synthesized, scored, and proven against safety contracts, then promoted through gated rollout workflows with rollback receipts.  
    **Why Compelling:** Incident response evolves from reactive patching to engineered, evidence-backed resilience upgrades.  
    **Rationale:** Systems with ambitious autonomy need equally ambitious validation loops to avoid compounding unseen risk.

15. **Claim compiler and public trust scoreboard**  
    **Entails:** Convert all external product claims (security, compatibility, performance, resilience) into executable claim specs that must map to measurable artifacts and verifier-checkable outputs.  
    **How It Works:** Claim compiler parses claim definitions, binds them to tests/benchmarks/proofs, blocks unverifiable language in docs/releases, and publishes a continuously updated public scoreboard with evidence links.  
    **Why Compelling:** Market messaging gains exceptional credibility because every major claim is coupled to living evidence, not one-time marketing snapshots.  
    **Rationale:** In disruptive category creation, trust leadership depends on making truth operational and continuously measurable.

## 9L. Verifiable Execution Fabric (VEF): Proof-Carrying Runtime Compliance
1. **Proof-carrying execution compliance fabric for high-risk extension actions**  
   **Entails:** Add a runtime-compliance fabric where high-risk extension actions (network, filesystem, process, secret access, policy transitions, artifact promotion) emit deterministic canonical receipts, and those receipts are mapped to machine-verifiable policy constraints.  
   **How It Works:** A policy-constraint compiler translates runtime policy into proof-checkable predicates; execution emits hash-chained receipt streams plus commitment checkpoints; proof workers generate compact compliance proofs over bounded receipt windows; verifiers validate proofs before claims are elevated and before sensitive control transitions remain in high-trust mode.  
   **Why Compelling:** This upgrades trust from "we logged and replayed it" to "we can cryptographically demonstrate policy compliance for what actually executed," which is a major category-level differentiation over wrapper-style security tooling.  
   **Rationale:** `franken_node` already has evidence ledger, replay, verifier SDK, and claim compiler primitives; VEF is the highest-EV accretive layer because it fuses those primitives into a single verifiable runtime-trust loop that external stakeholders can independently validate.

## 9M. Adversarial Trust Commons (ATC): Federated Behavioral Intelligence
1. **Privacy-preserving federated trust intelligence across participating deployments**  
   **Entails:** Add a federated intelligence layer where participating `franken_node` deployments contribute behavioral trust signals (anomaly fingerprints, trust-state transitions, revocation/quarantine triggers, attack-pattern sketches) without exposing raw sensitive telemetry.  
   **How It Works:** Each participant computes local summaries and submits cryptographically protected updates using secure aggregation, differential-privacy budgets, and mergeable sketches; global services compute ecosystem priors and emerging threat indicators; local control planes consume signed federation outputs to update risk posture and preemptive controls.  
   **Why Compelling:** This converts defense from isolated fortress mode into collective network defense, where high-quality detections in one environment improve prevention quality in all others while preserving privacy boundaries.  
   **Rationale:** The plan already includes adversary graphs, trust cards, verifier systems, and quarantine propagation; ATC is the highest-leverage next layer because it transforms those local capabilities into ecosystem-scale compounding intelligence that is structurally hard for incumbent runtimes to replicate.

## 9N. Dependency Graph Immune System (DGIS): Topological Contagion Modeling + Preemptive Containment
1. **Topology-aware dependency immunization and cascade preemption**  
   **Entails:** Treat the full dependency graph (direct + transitive packages, extension supply roots, publisher/maintainer trust signals, build-time/runtime edges) as a first-class attack surface and build a continuous immune system that predicts catastrophic cascade paths before compromise occurs.  
   **How It Works:** Maintain a canonical signed graph model; compute centrality/percolation/fan-out risk metrics; run adversarial contagion simulations over likely campaign classes (slow-burn maintainer takeover, staged typosquat pivot, delayed payload activation, build-pipeline poisoning); generate preemptive containment plans that insert trust barriers at topological choke points (behavioral sandboxes, composition firewalls, forced verified-fork pinning, constrained update windows); continuously fold ATC-derived global topology indicators into local posterior risk and re-plan barrier placement under policy and performance budgets.  
   **Why Compelling:** This changes security economics from reactive node-level defense to proactive graph-level immunization, shrinking blast radius before attackers can exploit high-leverage positions in the supply chain and making xz-style campaigns materially harder to execute at scale.  
   **Rationale:** Existing trust cards, adversary graph inference, quarantine, VEF proof gates, and ATC federation become multiplicatively stronger when topology is explicit in risk inference and containment policy; DGIS is the missing structural layer that converts these components into a coherent preemptive defense fabric.

## 9O. Behavioral Phenotype Evolution Tracker (BPET): Longitudinal Trust Genetics For Extensions
1. **Pre-compromise behavioral trajectory detection across extension lifecycles**  
   **Entails:** Model every extension as a longitudinal behavioral genome rather than a sequence of disconnected point-in-time snapshots, tracking phenotype evolution across versions, maintainer transitions, dependency rewrites, build-pipeline changes, capability usage shifts, API-surface growth, runtime resource envelopes, network behavior, and structural complexity trends.  
   **How It Works:** Build canonical per-version phenotype vectors and signed lineage chains; compute time-series drift features and regime-shift signals using changepoint detection, Hidden Markov behavioral-state inference, and survival-style hazard estimation for compromise-propensity progression risk; fuse trajectory risk with DGIS topological criticality and ATC federated priors; emit calibrated evolution-risk scores plus explanation traces that distinguish normal growth/refactor behavior from suspicious mutation patterns (capability creep, obfuscation ramps, dormant-to-active bursts, handoff-then-pivot sequences).  
   **Why Compelling:** This shifts detection from reactive mutation catching to predictive compromise precursors, allowing containment before malicious payloads are fully expressed and significantly reducing attacker dwell-time advantage in slow-burn campaigns.  
   **Rationale:** Trust cards, adversary graph scoring, migration gates, and operator decisions all gain major signal quality when temporal evolution becomes explicit; BPET adds the missing time dimension that converts a strong trust stack into a predictive trust stack.

## 10. Ultra-Detailed TODO (Program Level)
### 10.N Execution Normalization Contract (No Duplicate Implementations)
- `10.0` through `10.12` are strategic epics and coverage gates.
- `10.13` through `10.21` are canonical implementation-level work breakdowns.
- If the same capability appears in multiple tracks, exactly one canonical implementation path owns the protocol/code semantics; all other appearances are integration, adoption, policy, or release gating layers.
- Duplicate implementation of the same protocol semantics in parallel tracks is explicitly off-charter.
- Oracle delivery close condition: dual-layer oracle is only complete when L1 (`10.2`) + L2 (`10.17`) + release policy linkage (`10.2`) are all green.

Canonical ownership map (non-reductive, full-feature):
- remote registry/idempotency/saga semantics: canonical in `10.14`, integrated and policy-gated in `10.15`.
- epoch validity + transition barriers: canonical in `10.14`, integrated into control workflows in `10.15`.

- authenticated control channel + anti-replay framing: canonical protocol in `10.13`, adoption and policy rollout in `10.10` + `10.15`.
- revocation freshness semantics: canonical enforcement in `10.13`, ecosystem/policy adoption in `10.4` + `10.10`.
- stable error taxonomy and recovery contract: canonical definition in `10.13`, operations and product-surface adoption in `10.8` + `10.10`.
- trust protocol vectors/golden fixtures: canonical generation in `10.13` + `10.14`, release and publication gates in `10.7` + `10.10`.
- verifiable execution fabric (policy-constraint compiler + receipt commitments + proof generation/verification): canonical in `10.18`, consumed by `10.17` verifier/claim surfaces and enforced through `10.15` control-plane gates.
- adversarial trust commons federation (privacy-preserving signal sharing + global priors + incentive weighting): canonical in `10.19`, consumed by `10.17` adversary graph/reputation surfaces and enforced through `10.15` + `10.4` trust controls.
- dependency graph immune system (topological risk model + contagion simulator + preemptive barrier planner): canonical in `10.20`, consumed by `10.17` adversary/economic scoring, `10.15` control-plane containment, and `10.19` federated threat-intelligence enrichment.
- behavioral phenotype evolution tracker (longitudinal genome modeling + drift/regime-shift detection + hazard scoring): canonical in `10.21`, consumed by `10.17` adversary/trust scoring, `10.20` topological prioritization, `10.19` federated temporal intelligence, and `10.2`/`10.15` migration-control gating.
- spec-first Node/Bun compatibility extraction and fixture-oracle baselining: canonical in `10.2`, consumed by `10.3` migration automation and `10.7` release verification.

## 11. Evidence And Decision Contracts (Mandatory)
Every major subsystem proposal must include:
- change summary
- compatibility and threat evidence
- EV score and tier
- expected-loss model
- fallback trigger
- rollout wedge
- rollback command
- benchmark and correctness artifacts

No contract, no merge.

## 12. Risk Register
- Compatibility illusion risk:
  - Countermeasure: lockstep oracle + divergence receipts.
- Scope explosion:
  - Countermeasure: phase gates + artifact-gated delivery.
- Trust-system complexity:
  - Countermeasure: deterministic replay and explicit degraded-mode contracts.
- Migration friction persistence:
  - Countermeasure: migration autopilot and confidence reporting.
- Performance regressions from hardening:
  - Countermeasure: profile-governed tuning and p99 gates.

## 13. Program Success Criteria
`franken_node` is successful when:
- it delivers practical Node/Bun migration pathways with low operational risk
- compatibility claims are continuously validated by lockstep differential harnesses
- trust and security claims are externally verifiable and reproducible
- operator workflows can contain and explain high-severity incidents deterministically
- impossible-by-default capabilities are production-grade and adopted
- benchmark and verifier standards gain external usage

Concrete targets:
- `>= 95%` pass on targeted compatibility corpus
- `>= 3x` migration velocity improvement
- `>= 10x` host-compromise reduction under adversarial campaigns
- `<= 15 min` install-to-first-safe-production workload for representative setups

## 14. Public Benchmark + Standardization Strategy
`franken_node` will define and own public benchmark and verification standards for secure extension runtime products.

Commitments:
- publish benchmark specs, harness, datasets, scoring formulas
- include security and operational trust co-metrics (not speed-only)
- publish verifier toolkit for independent claim validation
- version standards with explicit migration guidance

Metric families:
- compatibility correctness by API family and risk band
- performance (`p50/p95/p99`, cold start, overhead under hardening)
- containment and revocation latency and convergence
- replay determinism and artifact completeness
- adversarial resilience under evolving campaign corpora
- migration speed and failure-rate improvements

## 15. Ecosystem Capture Strategy
`franken_node` must build durable network effects around trust-native extension operations.

Execution pillars:
- signed extension registry with strict provenance and revocation controls
- migration kit ecosystem for major Node/Bun project archetypes
- enterprise governance integrations (policy pipelines, audit export, compliance evidence)
- reputation graph APIs powering ecosystem-level trust and incident response
- partner and lighthouse programs proving category-shift outcomes in production

Adoption targets:
- time-to-first-safe-extension `<= 15 min` primary target; temporary early-rollout adoption floor `<= 30 min` for greenfield users with mandatory trend-down tracking to the primary target
- deterministic migration validation on representative Node/Bun project cohorts
- published case studies with measurable security and operational improvements

## 16. Scientific Contribution Targets
`franken_node` is an engineering program that should also produce reusable technical knowledge.

Required contributions:
- open specifications for product-layer trust and compatibility primitives
- reproducible migration and incident datasets
- publishable methodology for benchmark and verifier design
- external red-team and independent evaluation reports
- transparent technical reports including failures and corrective actions
